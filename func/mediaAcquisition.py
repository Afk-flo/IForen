    This file is designed in order to make the Media Acquisition process easier.
    Media aquisition is kind of complicated in IOS environment. Files can be found in various folder in a lot of differents places.
    Forthermore, the aquisition process can be complicated, even if the file are in the database, most of them will be stored in the Icloud.
    In the V1, we will try to catch as many local media as possible.
